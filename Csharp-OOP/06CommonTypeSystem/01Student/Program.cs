Use an enumeration for the specialties, universities and faculties. Override the standard methods, inherited by  System.Object: Equals(), ToString(), GetHashCode() and operators == and !=.
            //02: Add implementations of the ICloneable interface. The Clone() method should deeply copy all object's fields into a new object of type Student.
            //03: Implement the  IComparable<Student> interface to compare students by names (as first criteria, in lexicographic order) and by social security number (as second criteria, in increasing order).
